# Router

Message routing library for MessagingService on Roblox. Uses the [Cross-server Routing Protocol](https://www.github.com/tenx29/roblox-csrp) specification to route messages between servers.

## Installation

When using Rojo, using the `default.project.json` is recommended to install only the Router library.

The `test.project.json` file is provided for testing purposes, and will build a place file with the Router library and a unit testing module.
