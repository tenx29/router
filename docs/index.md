# About Router

Router is an open-source object-oriented framework for cross-server messaging on Roblox. Above all, Router is designed to be simple and easy to use, abstracting away the complexities of cross-server messaging. Router uses a custom [Cross-Server Routing Protocol](getting-started/protocol.md) to communicate between servers.

The Router library is written using strict type checking, making it integrate seamlessly with Roblox Studio's built-in code editor. Router is also designed to be used with [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) and [Wally](https://wally.run/), making it easy to integrate into your existing projects.
